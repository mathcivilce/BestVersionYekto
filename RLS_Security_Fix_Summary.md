# RLS Security Fix Summary

## 🚨 Critical Security Vulnerabilities Fixed

### **VULNERABILITY**: Cross-Business Data Access
- **Severity**: CRITICAL 
- **Impact**: Users could access emails, stores, and data from other businesses
- **Root Cause**: Overly permissive RLS policies with `qual = 'true'`

## 🔧 Issues Identified & Fixed

### 1. **Emails Table - CRITICAL**
- **Problem**: Policy "Authenticated users can access emails" allowed ANY authenticated user to access ALL emails
- **Fix**: Replaced with business-scoped policies:
  - `Business members can select emails`
  - `Business members can insert emails` 
  - `Business members can update emails`
  - `Business members can delete emails`

### 2. **Stores Table - CRITICAL**
- **Problem**: Policy "Authenticated users can access stores" allowed ANY authenticated user to access ALL stores
- **Fix**: Removed overly permissive policy, kept existing business-scoped policies

### 3. **Internal Notes Table**
- **Problem**: Mixed policies with some allowing cross-business access
- **Fix**: Implemented comprehensive business-scoped policies:
  - `Business members can select internal notes`
  - `Business members can insert internal notes`
  - `Business members can update internal notes` 
  - `Business members can delete internal notes`

### 4. **User Profiles Table**
- **Problem**: Policy "authenticated_users_can_read_profiles" allowed reading ANY user profile
- **Fix**: Replaced with `Business members can select profiles` (business-scoped + own profile)

## ✅ Security Measures Implemented

### 1. **Business-Scoped Access Control**
All policies now use proper business isolation:
```sql
store_id IN (
    SELECT s.id 
    FROM stores s
    JOIN user_profiles up ON up.business_id = s.business_id
    WHERE up.user_id = auth.uid()
)
```

### 2. **Row Level Security (RLS) Enforcement**
- ✅ RLS enabled on all critical tables
- ✅ RLS forced on sensitive tables (no owner bypass)
- ✅ Comprehensive policies for SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

### 3. **Policy Completeness**
| Table | RLS Enabled | Policy Count | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------------|---------|
| emails | ✅ | 4 | ✅ Secure |
| stores | ✅ | 4 | ✅ Secure |
| internal_notes | ✅ | 5 | ✅ Secure |
| email_replies | ✅ | 1 | ✅ Secure |
| user_profiles | ✅ | 4 | ✅ Secure |
| businesses | ✅ | 3 | ✅ Secure |
| analytics | ✅ | 2 | ✅ Secure |

## 🔍 Verification & Testing

### 1. **Dangerous Policy Detection**
- ✅ No policies with `qual = 'true'` (unrestricted access)
- ✅ No policies with `with_check = 'true'` (unrestricted writes)

### 2. **Business Isolation Testing**
- ✅ Users can only see data from their own business
- ✅ Cross-business queries return 0 results
- ✅ Data properly segmented by business_id

### 3. **Frontend Defense Layers**
- ✅ Business_id validation in InboxContext
- ✅ Explicit filtering in queries  
- ✅ Realtime subscription security checks

## 📋 Migration Applied

**Migration**: `20250605100000_fix_rls_security_comprehensive.sql`
- Dropped dangerous policies
- Created business-scoped policies for all critical tables
- Enabled and forced RLS on sensitive tables
- Comprehensive security audit included

## 🛡️ Security Audit Tools

### 1. **Security Audit Script**: `security-audit.sql`
- Verifies business isolation
- Tests for cross-business access vulnerabilities
- Checks policy completeness
- Detects dangerous policies

### 2. **Verification Queries**
Run these to verify security:
```sql
-- Should only return data from user's business
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT s.business_id) FROM emails e 
JOIN stores s ON s.id = e.store_id;

-- Should return 0 for cross-business access test
WITH user_business AS (
    SELECT business_id FROM user_profiles WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM emails e
JOIN stores s ON s.id = e.store_id
WHERE s.business_id NOT IN (SELECT business_id FROM user_business);
```

## ✅ Status: SECURITY VULNERABILITY RESOLVED

- ❌ **Before**: Cross-business data access possible
- ✅ **After**: Strict business isolation enforced
- ✅ **Frontend**: Additional defense layers implemented  
- ✅ **Database**: Comprehensive RLS policies in place
- ✅ **Verified**: Security audit confirms no vulnerabilities

## 🔮 Next Steps

1. **Regular Security Audits**: Run `security-audit.sql` periodically
2. **Policy Review**: Review any new RLS policies before deployment
3. **Testing**: Test with multiple users/businesses before major releases
4. **Monitoring**: Monitor for any policy conflicts in future migrations

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Always test RLS policies with multiple users from different businesses to ensure proper isolation.
