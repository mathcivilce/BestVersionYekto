# Robust Webhook System Implementation

## Overview

We have successfully implemented a comprehensive, enterprise-grade webhook monitoring and management system that addresses the orphaned subscription issue and provides robust error handling, monitoring, and auto-cleanup capabilities.

## Problem Analysis

### Root Cause: Orphaned Microsoft Graph Subscriptions
- **Issue**: Subscription ID `abdb9aac-039b-4aa1-aaa5-e6bd684ea4e4` exists on Microsoft's servers but not in our database
- **Impact**: Webhook errors, failed notifications, and log noise
- **Cause**: Database cleanup without corresponding Microsoft Graph cleanup during store disconnection or failed webhook creation

## Three-Tier Solution Implementation

### ðŸ”§ Solution 1: Proactive Cleanup System

**New Function**: `cleanup-orphaned-subscriptions`
- **Purpose**: Identifies and removes orphaned Microsoft Graph subscriptions
- **Process**:
  1. Queries all Microsoft Graph subscriptions for each connected store
  2. Compares with local database subscription records
  3. Identifies orphaned subscriptions (exist on Microsoft, not in database)
  4. Automatically deletes orphaned subscriptions from Microsoft Graph
  5. Logs all cleanup activities for audit trail

**Key Features**:
- âœ… Store-by-store processing for error isolation
- âœ… Token validation before cleanup attempts
- âœ… Comprehensive error handling and logging
- âœ… Detailed cleanup reporting and metrics
- âœ… Webhook URL validation to ensure only our app's subscriptions are affected

**Usage**:
```bash
# Manual execution
curl -X POST https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/cleanup-orphaned-subscriptions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Can be scheduled via cron or called periodically
```

### ðŸ“Š Solution 2: Enhanced Monitoring & Logging

**New Database Tables**:
1. **`webhook_errors`** - Tracks all webhook errors with detailed context
2. **`webhook_cleanup_log`** - Logs all cleanup activities and outcomes  
3. **`webhook_metrics`** - Performance metrics for webhook processing

**Enhanced Logging Features**:
- âœ… **Error Categorization**: Different error types (subscription_not_found, message_processing_error, etc.)
- âœ… **Performance Tracking**: Processing time, success rates, throughput metrics
- âœ… **Cleanup Auditing**: Complete audit trail of all cleanup activities
- âœ… **Resolution Tracking**: Mark errors as resolved with resolution notes
- âœ… **User Context**: Link errors to specific users and stores for targeted support

**New Dashboard Function**: `webhook-dashboard`
- **Real-time Metrics**: Success rates, processing times, error counts
- **Performance Analytics**: Hourly stats, processing time distribution, slowest webhooks
- **Error Analysis**: Error categorization, recent errors, unresolved issues
- **Cleanup Monitoring**: Cleanup success rates, orphaned subscription tracking
- **Subscription Health**: Active subscriptions, expiring subscriptions, health status

### ðŸ§¹ Solution 3: Intelligent Auto-Cleanup

**Enhanced `email-webhook` Function**:
- **Immediate Response**: When orphaned subscription detected, attempt auto-cleanup
- **Smart Store Selection**: Uses available connected stores for cleanup operations
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues processing even if cleanup fails
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Logs both successful and failed cleanup attempts
- **Error Resolution**: Automatically marks resolved errors in the database

**Auto-Cleanup Process**:
1. **Detection**: Webhook receives notification for unknown subscription
2. **Logging**: Log the error with full context and details
3. **Cleanup Attempt**: Try to delete orphaned subscription using available store token
4. **Resolution**: Mark error as resolved if cleanup successful
5. **Fallback**: Continue normal processing regardless of cleanup outcome

## Database Schema Enhancements

### New Tables Created

```sql
-- Webhook error tracking
CREATE TABLE webhook_errors (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  subscription_id text NOT NULL,
  error_type text NOT NULL,
  error_details jsonb,
  store_id uuid REFERENCES stores(id),
  user_id uuid REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  timestamp timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
  resolved boolean DEFAULT false,
  resolution_notes text
);

-- Cleanup activity logging
CREATE TABLE webhook_cleanup_log (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  store_id uuid REFERENCES stores(id),
  subscription_id text NOT NULL,
  action text NOT NULL,
  details jsonb,
  timestamp timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

-- Performance metrics
CREATE TABLE webhook_metrics (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  subscription_id text NOT NULL,
  store_id uuid REFERENCES stores(id),
  processing_time_ms integer,
  success boolean NOT NULL,
  error_message text,
  email_count integer DEFAULT 1,
  timestamp timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);
```

### Security & Performance
- âœ… **Row Level Security (RLS)** enabled on all new tables
- âœ… **Optimized indexes** for fast querying and reporting
- âœ… **User isolation** ensures users only see their own data
- âœ… **Service role access** for system operations

## Deployment Status

  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY"
```

### Dashboard Access
```bash
# Get webhook analytics
curl -X GET https://vjkofswgtffzyeuiainf.supabase.co/functions/v1/webhook-dashboard \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_USER_TOKEN"
```

### Monitoring Queries
```sql
-- Check recent webhook errors
SELECT * FROM webhook_errors 
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;

-- View cleanup activities
SELECT * FROM webhook_cleanup_log 
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;

-- Performance metrics
SELECT 
  DATE_TRUNC('hour', timestamp) as hour,
  COUNT(*) as total_webhooks,
  AVG(processing_time_ms) as avg_processing_time,
  SUM(CASE WHEN success THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)::float / COUNT(*) * 100 as success_rate
FROM webhook_metrics 
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY hour
ORDER BY hour;
```

## Maintenance & Operations

### Recommended Schedule
- **Daily**: Monitor dashboard for errors and performance
- **Weekly**: Run manual cleanup to catch any missed orphaned subscriptions
- **Monthly**: Review cleanup logs and optimize based on patterns

### Alerting Setup
Consider setting up alerts for:
- High error rates (>5% failure rate)
- Slow processing times (>5000ms average)
- Multiple orphaned subscriptions detected
- Cleanup failures

### Performance Optimization
- Monitor processing time distribution
- Identify and optimize slow webhooks
- Review error patterns for systemic issues
- Optimize database queries based on usage patterns
