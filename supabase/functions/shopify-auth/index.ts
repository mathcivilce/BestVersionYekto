 * 
 * Key Features (Planned):
 * - Shopify Partner API OAuth 2.0 implementation
 * - Shop domain validation and verification
 * - Secure access token exchange and storage
 * - Automatic webhook subscription setup
 * - Multi-tenant business association
 * - Error handling and user feedback
 * 
 * Security Features (Planned):

 * - API permission scope verification
 * - User authentication and business association
 * 
 * Shopify Integration (Planned):

 * - Customer data access for support
 * - Product catalog integration
 * - Inventory and fulfillment tracking
 * - Multi-store management support
 * 
 * Database Operations (Planned):
 * - stores table: Main store record with platform 'shopify'
 * - shopify_stores table: Shopify-specific credentials and settings
 * - webhook_subscriptions table: Shopify webhook configurations
 * - Business association for multi-tenant isolation
 * 
 * Used by (Future):
 * - Shopify app installation flows
 * - E-commerce store connection processes
 * - Multi-platform email management setup
 * - Customer support system integration
 *
