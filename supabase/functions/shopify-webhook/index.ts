/**
 * Shopify Webhook Handler Edge Function (Template)
 * 
 * This Deno Edge Function will handle incoming webhooks from Shopify stores
 * for real-time order notifications, customer updates, and inventory changes.
 * It will process various Shopify webhook events and trigger appropriate actions
 * in the email management system.
 * 
 * Planned Webhook Event Handling:
 * 1. Order creation and updates (new orders, fulfillment, cancellations)
 * 2. Customer creation and profile updates
 * 3. Payment notifications (paid, refunded, disputed)
 * 4. Inventory level changes and low stock alerts
 * 5. Product catalog updates and new arrivals
 * 6. Shipping and fulfillment status updates
 * 7. App uninstall and connection status changes
 * 
 * Key Features (Planned):
 * - Real-time order notification processing
 * - Customer data synchronization via webhooks
 * - Inventory tracking and low stock alerts
 * - Email automation trigger events
 * - Multi-store webhook management
 * - Webhook verification and security validation
 * 
 * Webhook Security (Planned):
 * - HMAC signature verification for authentic Shopify requests
 * - Request timestamp validation to prevent replay attacks
 * - IP address whitelisting for additional security
 * - Webhook secret rotation and management
 * - Error handling and retry mechanisms
 * 
 * Event Processing (Planned):
 * - Order notifications: Send confirmation emails, update CRM
 * - Fulfillment updates: Trigger shipping notifications
 * - Customer updates: Sync profile changes to email lists
 * - Inventory alerts: Notify staff of low stock levels
 * - Payment events: Handle transaction confirmations and disputes
 * - Product updates: Update marketing campaigns and catalogs

 * - Abandoned cart recovery sequences
 * - Post-purchase follow-up and review requests

 * - order_notifications table: Track order-related communications
 * - customer_sync_log table: Customer data synchronization tracking
 * - inventory_alerts table: Stock level monitoring and notifications
 * - Business association for multi-tenant webhook routing
 * 
 * Error Handling (Planned):
 * - Webhook event deduplication and idempotency
 * - Failed webhook retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
 * - Dead letter queue for persistently failing webhooks
 * - Comprehensive logging and monitoring for debugging
 * - Graceful degradation when downstream services are unavailable
 * 
 * Used by (Future):
 * - Real-time order processing workflows
 * - Customer data synchronization
 * - Email marketing automation
 * - Inventory management systems
 * - Customer support integration
 * - Analytics and reporting dashboards
 * 
 * Implementation Status: PLACEHOLDER
 * This function is currently a placeholder for future Shopify webhook implementation.
 * Will be developed when real-time Shopify integration features are prioritized.
